<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Every time a new (virtual) machine is created, pentesters often find themselves recreating their entire environment, including the window manager, terminal, software, configurations, and more. 
Inspired by Ippsec's video and repository, I've embarked on a journey with Ansible to simplify this process.

Feel free to fork this project to start you own version and add custom specifications ! 

Here's the goals:
* Optimize your Time: Your valuable time should be spent on meaningful tasks, not repetitive setup.
* Eliminate repetition: Say goodbye to performing the same tasks repeatedly; automate them.
* Rapid Machine Creation: with this project, you can create an identical machine within minutes.
* Flexibility in Configuration: quickly tailor the sensitivity of the pentester's machine to your needs.

## Sum-Up

The ansible playbook `main.yml` applies 10 ansible roles which are:

- roles/configure-i3
- gantsign.oh-my-zsh
- gantsign.golang
- roles/configure-zsh
- roles/install-tools
- gantsign.visual-studio-code
- roles/configure-firefox
- roles/configure-logging
- roles/configure-hardening
- roles/configure-terminals

## Pre-Install, Install, Update

I recommand to install ansible with pip instead of apt.
Starting from a nice and clean OS will avoid any trouble with dependencies and previous installati

```bash
# Pre-install
sudo apt install -y curl wget git # Basics
git clone https://github.com/clem9669/kali-build
cd kali-build
bash -x pre-install.sh

# Main Install
bash -x install.sh

```

It is possible to adjust the script with the 3 followings args `ansible-playbook main.yml -K -e "install_mode=full"`:
- light
- full (=> all tools)
- hard (=> hardening)
